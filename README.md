# Echo Factory

A performance delay by ZBAudio, built first for screen-reader users. AU, VST3 and Standalone for macOS.

Every control has a spoken title, description and value with units, and is
reachable by keyboard. The Perform pad turns the computer keyboard (or a MIDI
pad controller) into an instrument for playing the delay live.

## Features

- Delay time in ms or tempo-synced divisions, with adjustable glide
- Feedback, ping-pong, stereo width, Low Cut and High Cut (in the loop or on the output)
- **Wear**: tape saturation, darkening, wow and flutter
- **Diffusion**: a 16-line feedback delay network reverb that takes over the repeats
- **Multi-Tap**: up to 16 taps, each with its own time, level, pan, pitch and Reverse
- **Gestures**: Throw, Freeze, Tapestop, Runaway and Reverse, held or latched
- Factory presets, each with a spoken hint for which gesture to try

See [docs/perform-map.md](docs/perform-map.md) for the Perform-mode keys and the MIDI map.

## Install

Download the zip from [Releases](../../releases) and copy:

- `Echo Factory.component` to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`

The builds are ad-hoc signed, not notarized. macOS will quarantine them, so
clear the flag after copying:

```
